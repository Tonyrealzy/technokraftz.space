        <h1>TYPES OF LEAVES</h1>
        While there are many species of plants on the planet, there are two basic types of leaves, simple and compound.
        <br><br>
        <b>Simple Leaf Definition</b>
        <p>A simple leaf is described as a single lamina attached to a stem by one petiole. There is no division in the lamina or leaf blade. Some examples of simple leaves include pear, oak, guava, and oregano.</p>
        <b>Simple Leaf Examples</b>
        <p>Each of the images below illustrates examples of simple leaves. These are considered simple leaves as each leaf is attached to the stem by a petiole. Each leaf is a solid lamina with any divisions into separate leaflets. Examples of simple leaves include;
            <ul>
                <li>Pear tree leaves</li>
                <li>Guava tree leaves</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <b>Compound Leaf Definition</b>
        <p>
            A compound leaf is a divided leaf blade where the divisions are called leaflets. Two or more leaflets are attached to the midrib or main vein, which is attached to the petiole. There are several types of compound leaves, depending upon how the leaves are arranged and divided. In pinnately compound leaves, the leaflets are attached to the midrib. Examples of pinnately compound leaves include mimosa, acacia, and pea. Pinnately compound leaves are also classified by the number of leaflet branches off the midrib and the presence of a terminal leaflet. These include:
            <ol>
                <li>Unipinnate: leaflets border one midrib</li>
                <li>Bipinnate: two branches or axis of the midrib</li>
                <li>Tripinnate: three branches or axis of the midrib</li>
                <li>Parapinnate: no leaflet at the end of branch or axis</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            In palmately compound leaves, the leaflets attach at the tip of the petiole, just like fingers attach to a palm. Examples of palmately compound leaves include citrus, chestnut, and oxalis. Palmately compound leaves can be classified by the number of leaflets forming off the petiole:
            <ol>
                <li>Unifoliate: one leaflet</li>
                <li>Bifoliate: two leaflets</li>
                <li>Trifoliate: three leaflets</li>
                <li>Quadrifoliate: four leaflets</li>
                <li>Multifoliate: multiple leaflets</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Leaf comparison</h3>
        <b>Examples of Compound Leaves</b>
        <p>
            Compound leaves are found in a variety of plants. Below, some examples of pinnately and palmately compound leaves to demonstrate the different leaflet placements. Each of these examples demonstrates palmately compound leaves as the leaflets are arranged along the midrib (pinnately) or are attached at the petiole (palmately).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cassia - pinnately compound leaves</li>
            <li>Mimosa - pinnately compound leaves</li>
            <li>Poison ivy - palmately compound leaves</li>
            <li>Oxalis - palmately compound leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Difference Between Simple and Compound Leaf</b>
        <p>
            The main difference between simple and compound leaves centers on the lamina. If the lamina is undivided, it is a simple leaf. if the lamina is divided into smaller leaves (leaflets), then is it a compound leaf. The table below highlights the differences between simple and compound leaves.
